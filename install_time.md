## Installing the service

GigaComm had leaflet dropped my apartment block a few months ago and dropped them a note, they seemed OK but I couldn't  find any reviews online or information about the service and happy to try new technology I decided against messing with my current internet during lockdown and WFH.

#### **Research 📚:**

I've done some reading into the use of wireless / mmWave for backhaul (the connection back to the ISP) and Gigabit services and I've linked the ones for the company behind the technology used so read them knowing it's a vendors position. Breifly going back to the beer truck analogy and brewries and a statement made in my email to GigaComm have found a way way to shorten the distance to the brewery while lowering the cost of the building more breweries aka ehe cost of Gigabit per home. I assume the costs mentioned in the vendors artlce are in USD and uses cost structure fromt the US domestic market but still if Gigacom could get under AU$500 per customer this will work out for everyone.

The below artical is about the an US inicitive called the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund auction but gives a useful insight into delivering Gigabit capacity with low latency using both 60GHz (V Band) and/or 70/80 GHz (E Band) spectrum (in the USA) and some specs for the equipment I suspect is installed on the roof of buildings.

## So what's a fella doing on the roof❓

So one morning a rusty ex-ISP network engineer is looking out the window while brushing his teeth wondering what's the fella up on the roof doing with that mmWave receiver🤔, I wonder if thats GigaComm? Well the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) website will tell me what's on that roof and who is the company that holds the 70/80GHz band licence.

#### what's a fella doing on the roof, part 2:

What's the fella up on the roof doing, again? We had some heavy rain, thunder and wind over the past few days and there was a drop in the service for about 1min and I don't  believe I would have noticed but because it was raining outside I was inside doing some speed tests and writing up these notes. Don't get worried about mmWave and weather, here's some good facts and myths busting again I have linked the ones for the company behind the technology used so read them knowing it's a vendors position.

Howere I do wonder if heavy winds on a pole and/or magpie's 🦅 could cause future problems 🤔.

## Engineer visit 👷‍♀️

GigaComm had already sent me an email saying they'd be back in touch in the second week of Jan to book and install in due to the holidays etc so a little more that the normal 10 days before a field engineer could do some jumpering and install a NTD. I got a nice surprise however (1hr notice) because they were in the building to do a neighbours install. A very knowledgeable and professional guy (Sam) did the install.

## Ahhh this all makes sense now❗️

So all along i've wondered how are GigaComm decreasing the **Distance** and increase the frequency (**Time**) to deliver the **Speed** and because theres no discussion of a NTU during the sales process (that I could remember or point too) this is IMHO why there was some early GigaComm scepticism🤷‍♂️ SO I guess thank you for the addtional Mhz on the wire I guess.

**And incase you missed my point the about ordinary looking cardboard box is how GigaComm are delivering 1000/100Mbps over a single copper-pair.** Also I suspect the other side of this NTU is this Adtran equipment https://adtran.com/web/page/portal/Adtran/group/4504  

### Last few SpeedTests👋

I performed a last few SpeedTests on my TPG connection one at https://www.speedtest.net and the other at https://speed.cloudflare.com, more on the Cloudflare test to come but the second normally gives a lower speed but gives you a more realistic result IMHO.

### Wee opportunity for perfect missed 🙊

There was a little bit of delay as I ran-out to get a double socket, I knew I had a 4core 26AWG copper cable but only a single RJ11 (phone socket) in my unit. This was the reason I emailed them during the sales stage after they said *I could run my NBN / current internet provider side-by-side AND they use the current copper-pair from the basement to my unit*.



Left to right, TPG then GigaComm.

## Any we're live on GigaComm 🦄

Quick SpeedTest on the GigaComm connection 🙋‍♂️

🏎💨 **WOW IT'S Gfast**

#### Summary ✅

A smooth service to get to this point, highly recommend GigaComm

## Installing the service

### So what's fella up too❓

GigaComm had leaflet dropped my apartment block a few months ago and dropped them a note, they seemed OK but I couldn't  find any reviews online or information about the service and happy to try new technology I decided against messing with my current internet during lockdown and WFH.

So one morning a rusty ex-ISP network engineer is looking out the window while brushing his teeth wondering what's the fella up on the roof doing with that [Siklu EH-ANT-1ft](https://www.siklu.com/product/etherhaul-kilo-series/  ) mmWave receiver🤔, I wonder if thats GigaComm? Well the [ACMA website](https://web.acma.gov.au/rrl/client_search.client_lookup?pCLIENT_NO=20048150) will tell me what's on that roof and the company that holds the licence for a 70/80GHz band. The second picture is a zoomed and reflected image of what is on the roof of my building (sorry not great quality).

### Engineer visit 👷‍♀️

GigaComm had already sent me an email saying they'd be back in touch in the second week of Jan to book and install in due to the holidays etc so a little more that the normal 10 days before a field engineer could do some jumpering and install a NTD. I got a nice surprise however (1hr notice) because they were in the building to do a neighbours install. A very knowledgeable and professional guy (Sam) did the install.

I performed a last few SpeedTests on my TPG connection 👋 one at https://www.speedtest.net and the other at https://speed.cloudflare.com, more on the Cloudflare test to come but the second normally gives a lower speed but gives you a more realistic result IMHO.

There was a little bit of delay as I ran-out to get a double socket, I knew I had a 4core 26AWG copper cable but only a single RJ11 (phone socket) in my unit. This was the reason I emailed them during the sales stage after they said *I could run my NBN / current internet provider side-by-side AND they use the current copper-pair from the basement to my unit*.

Left to right, TPG then GigaComm.

Quick SpeedTest on the GigaComm connection 🙋‍♂️

WOW

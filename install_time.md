### So what's fella up too‚ùì 

One morning an enthusiast level rusty ex-ISP network engineer is looking out the window while brushing his teeth wondering what's the fella up on the roof doing with that [Siklu EH-ANT-1ft](https://www.siklu.com/product/etherhaul-kilo-series/  ) mmWave receiverü§î. Well, the [ACMA website](https://web.acma.gov.au/rrl/client_search.client_lookup?pCLIENT_NO=20048150) will tell me what's on that roof and the company that holds the licence for 70/80GHz band. The second picture is a zoomed and reflected image of what is on the roof of my building (sorry not great quality).

EOP Friday 28th Oct
==============================

Field Engineer called 7pm and said he could come out and drop another AdTran for me now he was on the other side of the harbour so he'd be about an hour.. There's no sense in getting someone to drive across the city on a Friday night so I said tomorrow is fine.

It's an awesome commitment to service, ðŸ’© happens as they say hardware fails so it's all good

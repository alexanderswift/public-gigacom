This folder is my note, thoughts and a record of the [https://www.gigacomm.net.au](https://www.gigacomm.net.au) onboarding journey to their Gigabit Internet service and anything else related to it/them.

Yes, I was sceptical of the claims too but **TL;DR**. It's Gigabit fast, reliable and IMHO it's a technology approach the NBN could have used for apartment complexes from the beginning.

Read on. 

- *Part 1, Ice Cream and Unicorns.*

- Part 2, installing the service.
- [Part 3, testing and final thoughts](https://github.com/alexanderswift/public-gigacom/blob/main/testing.md).
